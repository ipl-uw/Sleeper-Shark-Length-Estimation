# Fish Mask Prediction and Midline Estimation

This repository contains code for generating visualization figures of mask predictions and calculating midline estimations for fish images. The pipeline uses a YOLO model for segmentation and processes the data to compute midlines, bounding boxes, and fish lengths.

## Requirements

Ensure you have **Python** (version 3.8 or higher) installed on your system. You will also need `venv` or `virtualenv` for creating a virtual environment. All other dependencies will be installed during the setup process.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the environment for running the project. 

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following commands:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Next, create a virtual environment using the following commands:
    ```bash
    python -m venv shark
    ```

    If on macOS/linux:
    ```bash
    source shark/bin/activate
    ```

    If on Windows:
    ```bash
    shark\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. With the virtual environment active (youâ€™ll see the environment name, such as shark, displayed at the beginning of your terminal prompt), install the required Python libraries using pip using the following commands:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy opencv-python torch ultralytics imageio
    ```

## Running the Script

Make sure your input data (fish images) is placed in the VIDEO_DIR directory (specified by the config file), organized into subfolders. Each subfolder represents a separate set of images or a video clip. Run the script with the virtual environment activated:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Outputs
The following outputs will be generated (based on what flags you set in the config file):

1. Visualization Images: Segmentation masks and midline estimations will be saved in the VISUALIZE_OUTPUT_PATH (if enabled).
2. Videos: Videos combining processed frames will be saved in the VIDEO_OUTPUT_PATH (if enabled).
3. JSON Files: Metadata for each processed frame will be saved in the JSON_OUTPUT_PATH (if enabled).
4. CSV File: A file containing results with midline points, bounding boxes, and pixel lengths will be saved in the CSV_PATH (a csv file will always be generated).
